"""Functions that manipulate lists without using Python's built-in list methods.

The fundamental operations on lists in Python are those that are part of the
language syntax and/or cannot be implemented in terms of other list operations.
They include:

    * List indexing (some_list[index])
    * List indexing assignment (some_list[index] = value)
    * List slicing (some_list[start:end])
    * List slicing assignment (some_list[start:end] = another_list)
    * List index deletion (del some_list[index])
    * List slicing deletion (del some_list[start:end])

Implement functions that each use just one of the above operations.

The docstring of each function describes what it should do.

DO NOT USE ANY OF THE BUILT IN LIST METHODS, OR len()!
